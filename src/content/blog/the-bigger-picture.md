Earlier this year I turned 26 years old, passing the 'quarter life' mark I guess. Here is the main thing that I wish I knew a lot earlier.

## Take a step back and ask yourself why you are doing things ##
Like many other brown boys, I went down the usual pipeline.

Get a decent ATAR ➡️ Study Engineering ➡️ Get a Corporate Job

And to be completely honest, I did not spend much time being introspective and asking myself
why I was doing what I was doing. Instead, I was too focused on the 'nitty gritty' and 
essentially lost myself in the smaller details. 

I call this approach to a your studies and career a 'Bottom Up' approach. A 'Bottom Up' approach
means that you focus on developing a particular set of skils and then progressing onto the
next thing once those have developed without thinking about what you even wanted in the first place. In the best case of this approach, you get good at something really niche which
would then allow you to get a high income opportunity. The worst case of this approach, you
piss away 10 years of your life only to realise that you took 1000 steps in the wrong direction
and did not stop once to think about what you really value in your career and your life.

It was only towards the end of my first grad role that I took a step back and thought about
the life I wanted for myself and whether my current trajectory would allow me to achieve this.
I had an honest conversation with my manager at the time, and he gave some very candid but also
slightly depressing advice from his own journey (he had worked as en Electrical Engineer for
30+ years). This moment opened my eyes, and was the turning point which allowed me to 
take a 'Top Down' approach to my career.

A 'Top Down' approach means that you focus on the life you want to live and the career that
would allow you to achieve this. Forget about the titles and the usual progression for a moment,
and really reflect on what you value and what industry you believe aligns with what you value.
Once you have this picture in your head, you can work backwards to figure out what roles 
align best with what you have envisioned and you can pick a career accordingly. As expected,
you will not have all the answers straight away but by being introspective and asking yourself
"What do I want" you will be able to take a step in the right direction and slowly but surely
over months or years you will get yourself to a point where you can be proud of how far you
have come and proud of the path you went down.

So, if you are someone who feels lost about all this sort of stuff. Zoom all the way out at
first and then zoom in bit by bit to get a bit more of a specific idea of what you would
want to head into.
